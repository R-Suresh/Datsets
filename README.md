# MCQ Bot

This is the dataset of networking based books
The file source4 is the one that we want to modify
Remove all unnecessary stuff from it .
Make the entire file as a single paragraph.

Also make sure the modified file at each stage is in ansi encoding

Added notes about possible architecture to model_architecture.txt

Furthermore the question bank is added, the number of questions in each file indicated by the title of the file
## Overall model architecture
