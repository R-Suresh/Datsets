https://github.com/facebookresearch/DrQA
DrQA treats Wikipedia as a generic collection of articles and does not rely on its internal graph structure.
As a result, DrQA can be straightforwardly applied to any collection of documents.
reading unstructured data from wiki and answering - pretrained models present - linux +GPU


https://github.com/19rick96/QA
Includes codes for deep learning architectures aimed at question-answering.GloVe word embeddings have been used.(the kalam one)

3rd place winner in AI challenge

https://github.com/allenai/aristo-mini
Aristo mini model - faced codec error - raised issue - hunch is , if we use Linux the codec error could be solved
